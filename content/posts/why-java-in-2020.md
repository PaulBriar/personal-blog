## From JavaScript To Java - Part 1

Why would a JavaScript developer pick up Java in 2020?  Let me tell you a little about my story and I'll tell you why...

With the wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and being laid-off shortly thereafter, I decided to take this time as an opportunity to grow.  This growth was primarly focused on my skillset as a developer and on the areas of software development that I was really interested in.

I was a React/JavaScript developer at my past employer and quite enjoyed what I was doing but early on in my tech journey I knew I wanted to focus on backend development.  The issue is that it is very difficult, but not impossible, to get a backend development role with no professional experience.  The only type of people getting a backend role without computer science or math degrees behind them either lived in a large tech area like Silicon Valley where there are many more opportunities or were very very talented.  I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which has a healthy tech scene but is no Silicon Valley.

But everyone is learning JavaScript...

Just like anyone that started coding, I really struggled trying to decide which programming language to choose.  Don't let others tell you "the language doesn't matter, just build stuff".  While there is some truth to that statement, as many programming language have the same attributes like variables, arrays, objects/hash tables, for-loops, while-loops and helper methods.  If you're like me and have played around with a few different programming languages, then this is even more clear.

Where I think "the language doesn't matter, just build stuff" statement is wrong, is when you are looking to get a job in software development with these skills.  I can learn Haskell all day, master it and have one hell of a time finding someone to hire me with no professional experience.  Those employers looking to hire someone green are looking for them to fill a particular need within their project or organization.  That particular need is most likely not met by a generalist, it is met by a specialist.  For me, it was React!

React is by far the most popular front-end technology being used to build new user interfaces today and it is pure JavaScript, one of the most popular languages in 2020.  Go ahead and watch 100 youtube videos about which language to choose this year and they will most likely say something like JavaScript, Python, Swift, Java, etc.  JavaScript is huge and if you want to break into the industry, I have no doubt I would tell you to focus on JavaScript to get hired... it worked for me!

Now, having played around with many languages including PHP, C, C++, Ruby, Python, C#, Java, there is no language that I can find like Java that is so huge, so powerful and has such a massive community to draw resources from.  In particular, when I look at the Spring Framework, my sheltered JavaScript mind is blown away by what it can do, like microservices, reactive programming, cloud native, web apps, serverless to name a few.  The depth of the framework and programming knowledge necessary to wield it properly was very intimidating to me but I like a challenge.

Programming in Java, coming from JavaScript, feels like moving from development to engineering to me.  Java being such a verbose and strongly typed language requires you to focus on programming skills that really do not matter in the world of a junior/intermediate React developer.  Things like SOLID design principles and OOP, while good to know as a React developer, never came up in my experience.  Nor did any type of data structure other than arrays or objects.  

In Java on the other hand, not only are design princples and deep OOP knowledge important but these skills are necessary to build a proper RESTful api in Java and the Spring Framework.  And data structures, how about ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, Enumeration, BitSet, Dictionary, HashTable and Properties to name most but not all Java data structures.  There may be only around 6 of these that you will use in most of your Java applications but that is still three times as many data structure to think about than in JavaScript.  Now I know JavaScipt has more than just arrays and objects, but I have yet to see any Sets, WeakSets, Maps or WeakMaps in production... maybe you would see a few of those at one of the big FAANG companies!

In Part 2 i'll go into more depth on why I think Java is a great decision in 2020 and in particular the Spring Framework...

Thanks for reading!
